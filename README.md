## General Requirements

### a. Deploy Website with professional profile
I created a personal website using HTML, CSS, and Bootsrap on GitHub pages. The site includes contact information, my education, a work experience section, and a downloadable resume.

### b. Create waph.html
I made a seperate course description page that provides an overview of the course and each lab and hackathon and individual projects. It is connected to the main page via a link.

## Non-technical Requirements

### a. Boostrap
In the main page I used a Bootstrap frameowrk to make my website visually appealing. It has some layout grids, and a navigation bar for a custom and clean look.

### b. Page tracker
At the bottom of the page I added in a Flag Counter to track visitors based on geographic locations.

## Technical Requirements

### a. jQuery for Clocks and Toggle
I used jQuery to create a live updating digital and analog clock like in previous lab. I also added in a show my email that toggles displaying my email. Finally I added a toggle button to change the theme of the website.

### b. JokeAPI and NASA API
I added two public APIs, one was a the JopkeAPI which will display a new joke evey 1 minute. The second API was a daily NASA photo that shows a stunning photo with a title and description of what we are looking at.

### c. JavaScript Cookies
I implemented JavaScript cookies to track visits. On a viewers first visit it displays a site alert "Welcome to my homepage for the first time!" and for returning visitors it will alert for the last time they visited the site.
