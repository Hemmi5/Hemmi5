				<h3> Web Application and Hacking Course Overview </h3>
					<p> A course overview</p>
				<h3>Lab 0 </h3>
					<p> Lab 0 introduces students to the foundational setup required for the WAPH course. The primary goal of this lab is to establish a fully functional development environment using Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machin in VirtualBox. In Part 1, we install essential software and applications, including the Apache web server, to prepare for future web development and security labs. In Part 2, we work with Git by cloning both the course repository and our own private repository. We also completed a series of Git-ralated exercises, such as generating SSH keys and making our first commits. The lab emphasizes proper documentation practices by requiring us to write a structured report in Markdown format and convert it to PDF using the Pandoc tool. This intial lab ensures that we all have a consistent, secure, and ready to use enviroment for completing future labs.</p>
				<h3> Lab 1 </h3>
					<p> In lab 1, I explored foundational concepts in web developement and the HTTP protocol by working with Wireshark, telnet, C CGI programming, and PHP. THe lab was split up into 2 parts: understanding how the web and HTTP works, and implementing basic web applications using C and PHP. Some of the key putcomes I learned were how to capture and analyze HTTP traffic using Wireshark, I practiced sending raw HTTP requests using telnet. I also developed basic CGI program witten in C that outputs HTML, I created a simple PHP application and an echo.php page to handle user inputs. Finally I campared the outputs of GET and POST methods and the corresponding HTTP messages where I gained insight into how data is included in URLS versus in the body of the requests. </p>
				<h3> Lab 2 </h3>
					<p> In Lab 2, I worked through several key front-end development concepts including HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Ajax, jQuery, and Web API integration. The lab was divided into two main tasks. The first involved building a single-page HTML application that integrates forms, client-side interactivity using JavaScript, and dynamic content like clocks. The second task focused on asynchronous requests and external styling using Ajax, jQuery, and external APIs. I practiced working with real-time data and integrating web services into static HTML pages, enhancing my understanding of responsive web interfaces and secure data handling. </p>
				<h3> Hackathon 1 </h3>
					<p>In Hackathon 1 it builds on concepts from Lab 1 and Lab 2, focusing on identifying and exploiting reflected XSS vulnerabilities and implementing defenses. I successfully completed Levels 0–5 by injecting JavaScript payloads to display my name via `alert()`. Level 6 was attempted but not completed. In Task 2, I implemented defenses in my frontend and backend code by sanitizing inputs, encoding outputs, and updating logic in `email.js`, `echo.php`, and `waph-hemmeraj.html`.</p>
